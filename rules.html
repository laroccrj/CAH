				<h1>Rules</h1>
				<p>
					To start the game, each player gets 10 white cards.
				</p>
				<p>
					A random black card will be selected which is either fill-in-the-blank or a question.
				</p>
				<p>
					The game will then ask you to pass to a player. This player then clicks "Ready" and can view the black card, and their white cards. The player then chooses a white card to either complete the fill-in-the-blank or answer the question. The game will asked to be passed to all but one player so everyone can submit a white card. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The last player is the Card Czar. The game will ask you to pass to the Card Czar. The Card Czar will see the black card and all the white cards the other players submitted this round. The Card Czar will then read the black card for each white card, making sure to either complete the fill-in-the-blank, or answer the question with the white card.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Card Czar then selects what their favorite white card was. The player who played that card gets an awesome point.
				</p>
				<p>
					Then a new Card Czar and black card will be selected and a new round will start. 
				</p>
				<p>
					The winner is the player with the most awesome points when you feel like ending the game.
